# one sentence overview of the paper - 

In response to etoposide it is evident that cells exploit different mechanisms normally used to repair DNA damages. The available data suggest a peculiarity of etoposide with respect to other DNA damaging agents.

# # # Steps for resolution of etoposide induced DNA damage

# Step 1

The first step necessary to repair the type of DNA damage, either single- or double-stranded, induced by etoposide requires the removal of Topo II from the 50-end of the break.


As expected from its ability to induce DSBs, eto- poside triggers the activation of the ATM pathway, a hallmark of which being the phosphorylation pat- tern of the downstream Chk2 kinase (Masser et al 1997, Molecular and Cellular Biology)

Mutation of the ATM kinase, as in cells deriving from ataxia telengectasia (AT) patients, results in hypersensitivity to etoposide accompanied by an increased rate of chromosomal aberrations ( )

# # # Suggesting that ATM kinase/signaling might modulate Top2cc removal

Surprisingly, etoposide induces also the activa- tion of the S-phase specific checkpoint pathway identified by ATR, Rad9-containing clamps (Rad9, Hus1 and Rad1, known as the 9-1-1 complex) and downstream Chk1 kinase (Rossi et al 2006, Cancer Research)

# # # Effects on DNA replication

However, etoposide induces a progres- sive inhibition of DNA replication that is clearly detectable after the formation of RPA foci, i.e. after 1 h of growth in the presence of the drug (Rossi et al 2006, Cancer Research & Montecucco et al 2001, Molecular biology of the cell)

Several data strongly support the notion that inhibition of DNA replication in response to etoposide is due to the ATR pathway whereas ATM kinase, although activated, appears to be dispensable (Rossi et al 2006, Cancer Research)

# # # Apoptosis

Most of the drugs used in cancer therapy, includ- ing etoposide, induce apoptosis mainly through the cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9 pathway. However, the Fas-mediated death signaling pathway has been recently shown to significantly contribute to apop- tosis induced by etoposide (Wange et al 2006, Cellular Signaling)
